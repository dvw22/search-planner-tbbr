function [connectivity,connective_parts] = slice_connectivity(slice)
% slice_connectivity Calculates the number of connected segments and
% returns their indices
%   If the previous index is a 0 and this one is a 1, a connectivity has
%   opened. Log this point as a start point. Otherwise, if the previous 
    index is a 1 and this one is a 0 and a connectivity was opened, a 
    connectivity
%   has closed. Log this point as an end point. 
%   Try to track the number of connectivities. The start and end of a
%   connectivity should occupy a row.
