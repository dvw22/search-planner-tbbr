# Search Planner Simulator (for a mobile Search and Rescue Robot)
This project contains 

## Prerequisites
This project was developed in MATLAB and MATLAB is required to run this. I recommend using the latest version, MATLAB 2020b - the project has not been tested thoroughly on other versions of MATLAB.

The following toolboxes are dependencies, and so must be installed via MATLAB's add-on manager:
* Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox (https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66586-mobile-robotics-simulation-toolbox)
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (https://uk.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html)

Please be aware that the aforementioned toolboxes will in turn have their own toolbox dependencies. Links have been provided for further information.

Simulations are planar and thus from my experience are not overly computationally complex. For a reference I developed this project and ran simulations on a 2013 Macbook Air with an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM.

## Setup
Clone the repository into a directory of your choice that is accessible to MATLAB. Open the directory in MATLAB's file explorer and the Search Planner Simulator should be ready to use.
